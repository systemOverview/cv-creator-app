# CV Creator

This is my first react project. I developed it as a fun project to practice what I've learnt about HTML/CSS/Js and react. It allows a user to create a simple yet a usable CV directly from their browser. I've used react-pdf library for mostly everything about the PDF rendering and generation. 

## Demo

I have deployed the app on Vercel if you want to check it out :
